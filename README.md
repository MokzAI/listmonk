# Listmonk with Docker Compose for Coolify

## Introduction

This is the [docker compose file](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/templates/compose/listmonk.yaml) for Listmonk from Coolify but with CORS enabled for localhost and mokz.ai domain so the Listmonk API could be accessed by my apps.

## Use in Coolify

Copy and paste the `docker-compose.yml` file into a new Docker Compose project in Coolify. Set the domain properly and deploy.
